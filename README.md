##   Building a Netflix Clone with Flutter and DevSecOps on AWS! 

**Excited to share my latest project: a Netflix-style web app built with Flutter and deployed using a robust DevSecOps pipeline on AWS!**

This project showcases the power of Flutter for creating beautiful and performant web applications, along with the efficiency of DevSecOps practices. Here's a glimpse into the key steps:

**1. Building the App:**
   - Utilized the **Flutter framework** to develop a user-friendly and visually appealing web app.

**2. Setting the Stage:**
   - Launched an **Ubuntu (22.04) T2 Large Instance** on AWS for our infrastructure.

**3. Building the Toolkit:**
   - Installed **Jenkins, Docker, and Trivy** to manage automation, containerization, and security vulnerability scanning, respectively.

**4. Data Connection:**
   - Secured a **TMDB API Key** to access movie data for the app.

**5. Monitoring and Visualization:**
   - Set up **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for application performance monitoring and visualization.

**6. Alarms and Notifications:**
   - Integrated **Prometheus Plugin** with the server and configured **email integration with Jenkins** for automated notifications.

**7. Security and Dependency Management:**
   - Installed plugins like **JDK, Nodejs, and OWASP Dependency Check** to address security concerns and manage dependencies effectively.

**8. Automation with Jenkins:**
   - Created a **Declarative Pipeline Project** in Jenkins to automate the CI/CD process.

**9. Security Scans & Build:**
   - Integrated **OWASP Dependency Check Plugins** for vulnerability scanning and used the Jenkins pipeline to **build and push Docker images**.

**10. App Launch:**
   - Successfully deployed the web app, accessible on the browser!

This project demonstrates my expertise in:

* **Flutter development:** Building engaging web experiences with Flutter.
* **DevSecOps practices:** Implementing security and automation throughout the development lifecycle.
* **AWS cloud:** Utilizing AWS services for infrastructure and scalability.
* **CI/CD pipeline automation:** Streamlining deployment with Jenkins.
* **Containerization:** Leveraging Docker for efficient packaging and distribution.
